                <p class="v3-text-block">
                    Aspen was conceived by Phyllis Johnson, a former editor for Women's Wear Daily and Advertising Age. While wintering in Aspen, Colorado, she got the idea for a multimedia magazine, designed by artists, that would showcase “culture along with play.” So in the winter of 1965, she published her first issue. “We wanted to get away from the bound magazine format, which is really quite restrictive,” said Johnson.
                    <br><br>
                   Each issue had a new designer and editor. “Aspen,” Johnson said, “should be a time capsule of a certain period, point of view, or person.” The subject matter of issue number 1 and issue number 2 stayed close to the magazine's namesake ski spa, with features on Aspen's film and music festivals, skiing, mountain wildlife, and local architecture. Andy Warhol and David Dalton broke that mold with issue number 3, the superb Pop Art issue, devoted to New York art and counterculture scenes. Quentin Fiore designed issue number 4, a McLuhanesque look at our media-made society. The next issue, a double issue number 5+6, was an imaginative, wide-ranging look at conceptual art, minimalist art, and postmodern critical theory. Issue number 6A, a freebie sent to ever-patient subscribers, was a review of the performance art scene centered at New York's Judson Gallery. Next came issue number 7, exploring new voices in British arts and culture. Issue number 8, designed by George Maciunas and edited by Dan Graham, was dominated by artists of the Fluxus group. Issue number 9 plumbed the art and literature of the psychedelic drug movement. The last Aspen, issue number 10, was devoted to Asian art and philosophy.
                    <br><br>
                    If Aspen was an art director's dream, it was also an advertiser's nightmare. The ads, stashed at the bottom of the box, were easily ignored. And although Aspen was supposed to publish quarterly, in reality the publication date of each issue was as much of a surprise as the contents. “All the artists are such shadowy characters,” publisher Johnson said, “that it takes months to track them down.” After issue 5+6, there were no more ads in the magazine.
                     <br><br>
                     Perhaps Aspen was a folly, but it was a vastly pleasurable one, with a significant place in art history. The list of contributors included some of the most interesting artists of the 20th Century. And as an examplar of creative publishing, Aspen was a wonder. Its contents, however, are all but lost: few copies of Aspen have survived. The aim of this web site is to make these contents accessible again.

                <p class="v3-text-block">
                    Almost every issue of Aspen included at least one phonograph recording. In all, the magazine issued 13 flexi-discs showcasing 24 artists who ran the gamut of avant garde literature, art, and sonic experimentation. Except for two recordings — a jam by the Bill Evans Trio and a reading by William S. Burroughs — all were made expressly for Aspen. All the Aspen recordings are included here in forty audio exhibits, in both Real Audio and mp3 formats. (You will find two links to each mp3 file, “mp3” and “alt mp3”. Try both and use the one that works best for you.)
                    <br><br>
                    The recordings can be divided into six categories: spoken word recordings, electronic music, classical music, psychedelic music, jazz music, and avant-pop music.
                 <br><br>
                 SPOKEN WORD: 9 artists, 14 recordings. Recordings of the spoken voice make up fourteen exhibits. Eleven of these capture the voice of an author reading from a previously published work: you can hear the voice of artist Marcel Duchamp, Constructivist Naum Gabo, “Dada drummer” Richard Huelsenbeck, dancer Merce Cunningham, and writers William S. Burroughs, Christopher Logue, and Alain Robbe-Grillet. The other three recordings are The Young Turtle Assymetries, a one-of-a-kind performance piece for five voices, by Jackson MacLow; a text by Samuel Beckett, read by an actor; and dancer Merce Cunningham's Further Thoughts, consisting of extemporized responses to (unrecorded) questions from an interviewer.
               <br><br>
               ELECTRONIC: 6 artists, 6 recordings. Experiments in electronic music, vintage 1960s, make up six recordings. In Memoriam Edgar Varèse, by Mario Davidovsky, is accessible and amusing; Horn, by Gordon Mumma, is a daunting earful; Fontana Mix and Drift Study, by John Cage and LaMonte Young, are more enjoyable in concept than in production. Loop, by John Cale, is a clever exercise for guitar and feedback that curves back on itself in two ways: the final groove in the record is continuous, repeating endlessly, and if you restart the recording you will find that the closing, endlessly repeating riff leads off the record too. In Radio Play, John Lennon attempts to extract melodies from a radio tuner, using only the volume knob.
               <br><br>
               CLASSICAL: 3 artists, 11 recordings including 3 of commentary. Three Classical musicians are included. Fin-de-siècle Russian composer Alexander Scriabin is presented in four excerpts, accompanied by three short comments on the music. The other two Classical artists are contemporary: in Morton Feldman's The King of Denmark, long silences are punctuated by waves of percussion, while John Tavener's Three Songs for Surrealists are atmospheric works for voice and other instruments.
               <br><br>
               PSYCHEDELIC: 3 artists, 3 recordings. Three recordings drew inspiration from the 1960s craze for psychedelic drugs. White Wind features interesting raga-styled acoustic guitar playing by Peter Walker, who accompanied Tim Leary's touring expo of the expanded mind in 1966. The other two recordings are The Joyous Lake, an enthusiastic Eastern-influenced hootenanny, and Spontaneous Sound, a piece played on a collection of unusual indigenous musical instruments, sequentially and more or less at random. Both were included in the Psychedelic issue no. 9.
                <br><br>
                JAZZ: 2 groups of musicians, 2 recordings. Two recordings are in the Jazz genre, in contrasting styles: Israel exemplifies bop Jazz, while Saint James Infirmary Blues, featuring the clarinet of Peanuts Hucko, is in a more old-fashioned Dixieland style.
                <br><br>
            AVANT-POP: 1 artist, 4 recordings. The term “avant-pop” is used to make a genre into which Yoko Ono can be fitted. She sings three songs; if you're not a fan, the poignant Let's Go On Flying could make you into one. Also included is a collaboration between Ono and John Lennon (Lennon is barely audible), chanting the texts of newspaper stories about themselves.

        <div class="v3-label">ABOUT THE FILMS // 004</div>
        <p class="v3-text-block">
            Aspen no. 5+6 included a reel of motion picture film, in the Super-8mm format. On it were four short films by well-known artists, for about fifteen minutes of footage. All four films are included here in both QuickTime and Real Player formats. Though Aspen's film was silent, you can choose a soundtrack from among the forty audio exhibits.
        </p>
            Rhythm 21 is a study in geometric composition by Hans Richter, in which variously-shaded rectangles grow, shrink, and alter their proportions. For a soundtrack, I like John Cale's Loop; Mario Davidovsky's In Memoriam Edgar Varese is a good choice too.
            <br><br>
            Lightplay, by Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, is a montage of shining machine parts, filmed through a faceted lens and in multiple exposures. The apparatus on display is the artist's “Light display machine,” a kinetic sculpture constructed 1922-30. For a soundtrack, Alexander Scriabin's Prelude D Flat Major, Op. 11, No. 9 and his Prelude E Major, Op. 11 No. 15 are almost equally lovely. Neatly, they are of almost the same duration as the film clip.
            <br><br>
            In Site, by Robert Morris and Stan VanDerBeek, a performer unveils a new incarnation of Manet's Olympia, and plays with a large piece of building material. For a soundtrack, play The King of Denmark, by Morton Feldman, until the film ends.
            <br><br>
            Linoleum was conceived by Robert Rauschenberg as an ad hoc experiment in dance, “pedestrian movement,” and stage design. Among its highlights was a performer scooting across the stage “encased in chicken wire, surrounded by live white chickens, while munching on fried chicken,” while Rauschenberg and another performer layed wet noodles end-to-end across the stage (Rauschenberg: Art & Life, by Mary Lynn Katz). For a soundtrack, I like John Tavener's Song for Salvador Dali. It is too short by about a minute; one solution is to replay the audio until the film ends.

                    <p class="text-justified">Once upon a time there was a beautiful canyon— beautiful enough for a fairy tale— narrow and winding, walled in by castle-like cliffs jutting straight up one thousand feet. But unlike most fairy tales, this canyon was not to live happily ever after.</p>

                    <p class="text-justified">One of the joys of driving through the canyon is the winding road with surprise views at every curve. True, you can't go 60 miles an hour because of the curves, but when you go 60 miles an hour what do you see? Perhaps it's time we reserve a few roads for scenery and forget the speed. Where the cliffs tower the highest and the canyon is the narrowest (in other words, the most beautiful stretches of the canyon), the interstate highway will tunnel through the cliffs— thus giving us a long, dark hole to savor instead of a monumental view.</p>

                        An alternate route considered for the Glenwood Canyon highway traverses the top of the canyon. The old Cottonwood Pass stagecoach road, it climbs in an easy pattern to a high, rolling plateau, offering a top-ofthe-world view of the countryside. If this alternate route were chosen, the canyon could be kept as a scenic drive while the truckers and the impatient cross-country drivers zoomed at interstate speeds over the plateau. Both routes cost approximately the same to build.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justified" style="margin-top: 10px;">
                        However, the highway department decided against the alternate route because it was several miles longer and "Interstate is meant to be built along the shortest possible route because each additional mile costs the motorist," according to the resident engineer in Glenwood Springs. "If you figure 10 cents for each ' additional mile times 6,000 motorists daily times 365 days a year and figure the lifetime of the highway at say 50 years...." That's how they figure it.

Now these highway trucks are stored there for the winter, smack in the middle of the No Name community. Across the road stands a large truck trailer; on the opposite corner there's a huge orange crane— eyesores abandoned for the winter by the highway department in an area which the state legislature once deemed too beautiful for billboards. How to save America from Americans, that's the problem.</p>

                    <p class="text-justified">Its name is Glenwood Canyon, a spectacular twelve-mile gorge carved by the mighty Colorado River just above Glenwood Springs, Colorado. In many places, it is so narrow there is barely room for the road, river, and railroad track. It is so beautiful that long ago, the state legislature banned billboards the length and breadth of the canyon, years before billboards became a public controversy.</p>

                    <p class="text-justified">One of the delights of the canyon is its embellishment of foliage along the river's edge— the cottonwoods and Russian olives, the scrub oak and evergreens which are a brilliant foil for the yellow and red cliffs. But now the trees and the cliffs will be bulldozed and blasted away to make room for a highway three times the width of the present one.</p>

Of course, in this automobile age, we do need express highways. But must they destroy something unique and beautiful? Something the river took aeons to build; something man can never patch together again? Perhaps the canyon should have been preserved as an easily accessible beauty spot in the midst of a burgeoning area— a twelve-mile "packaged" park with room for fishing and camping areas, complete with horseback and self-guiding nature trails (the canyon is an open book for those who'll read its history etched by time in the serrated rock).</p>

                        The first section of the Glenwood Canyon Interstate was completed last fall in the No Name Creek area. Here a score of families had built their own Walden, leaving the creek, meadows, and mountain vistas unscarred. Now through their midst and their view roars the Interstate, a vast expanse of paving and tunnels, bristling with road signs, bordered by bare earth and boulders, all surrounding trees and shrubbery having been bulldozed and burned.

The highway department has decided it would make a fine route for a four-lane interstate expressway, so people can speed unseeingly through one of the most scenic areas in the country. Now you can play "Twenty Questions" all through the canyon without being distracted by the scenery.</p>

                    <p class="text-justified">Perhaps the time has come when we must practice conservation at our doorsteps, and not be content with merely preserving wilderness areas in isolated sections. In a way, the canyon is a symbol of the kind of decision communities all over the U.S. are having to make. Do we let the U.S. turn into a maze of mass habitation and transportation, allowing highways to blast through anywhere to speed us from one strip ciry to the next, letting urban sprawl ooze across the landscape like festering sores?</p>
                    <p class="text-justified" style="margin-top:10px">Or do we decide to preserve and treasure what we have not way off in the wilderness, but right in the midst of where people are living where it can be enjoyed daily. No wonder plans are afoot to flood parts of Grand Canyon and saw the Redwoods into lumber; if people won't get disturbed about whawhat is going on right where they live, why will they care about destruction in remote areas?</p>

                        There's not much man can do to improve a creek like this one, called No Name, according to legend, because "no name was beautiful enough to describe it." This is how the highway department preserved it. Twenty years ago, one family built their home around this view; now they contemplate their creek through a giant culvert, 11 ft. in diameter, buried beneath a 50-ft. dirt foundation for the highway.
